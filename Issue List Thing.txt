Things to remember to do! Yes notepad formating is amazing
//I can't spell

**means completed**
-----------------------------

Enemies and Towers
------
Enemies to cause differing amount of lives to be taken (base 1 atm)
**Different towers to give different ammo that causes differing damage**
Figure out that damn AOE tower, all the others are variable changes
Add other enemies into spawn script, shouldn't take long.. just need to tweak the random algorithim

UI
----
Better font for onscreen text and possibly main menu?
More options in the main menu - Level select? Options? Tutorial?

Gameplay
------
At the end of the level, death or win, need some kind of pop up UI
Start designing or adding new levels, we should aim for at least 3-5?
P.S - The mechanic of adding new levels will take half an hour at most
PP.S - Remap bases, waypoints
PPP.S - Add UI text, Add GM scripts
PPPP.S - Re-reference everything
PPPPP.S - We could even just copy pasta Level1 and change the things there, saves on reassigning vars n stuff

Sound
-----
Find a decent soundtrack and get it working
Sound effects of shooting/death/cookies/placement etc?

Graphics
-----
Add in the final assets:
Cookie for cookie count?
Speedy enemy
3 Other towers
(possibly animate the towers?)

Save Game
----
If we have progressive levels, it'll be just saving how far into the game they've got


Kirby,
I remain.
